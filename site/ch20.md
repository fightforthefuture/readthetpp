#### Article 20.2 Objectives

1\. The objectives of this Chapter are to promote mutually supportive trade and environmental policies; promote high levels of environmental protection and effective enforcement of environmental laws; and enhance the capacities of the Parties to address trade-related environmental issues, including through cooperation.

2\. Taking account of their respective national priorities and circumstances, the Parties recognize that enhanced cooperation to protect and conserve the environment and sustainably manage their natural resources brings benefits that can contribute to sustainable development, strengthen their environmental governance and complement the objectives of this Agreement.

3\. The Parties further recognise that it is inappropriate to establish or use their environmental laws or other measures in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on trade or investment between the Parties.

#### Article 20.3: General Commitments

1\. The Parties recognise the importance of mutually supportive trade and environmental policies and practices to improve environmental protection in the furtherance of sustainable development.

2\. The Parties recognise the sovereign right of each Party to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection and its own environmental priorities, and to establish, adopt or modify its environmental laws and policies accordingly**.**

3\. Each Party shall strive to ensure that itsenvironmental laws and policies provide for, and encourage, high levels of environmental protection and to continue to improve its respective levels of environmental protection**.**

4\. No Party shall fail to effectively enforce its environmental laws through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties, after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

5\. The Parties recognise that each Party retains the right to exercise discretion and to make decisions regarding: (a) investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory and compliance matters; and (b) the allocation of environmental enforcement resources with respect to other environmental laws determined to have higher priorities. Accordingly, the Parties understand that with respect to the enforcement of environmental laws a Party is in compliance with paragraph 4 if a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of that discretion, or results from a _bona fide_ decision regarding the allocation of those resources in accordance with priorities for enforcement of its environmental laws.

6\. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the Parties recognise that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protection afforded in their respective environmental laws. Accordingly, a Party shall not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, its environmental laws in a manner that weakens or reduces the protection afforded in those laws in order to encourage trade or investment between the Parties.

7\. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to empower a Party’s authorities to undertake environmental law enforcement activities in the territory of another Party.

#### Article 20.4: Multilateral Environmental Agreements

1\. The Parties recognise that multilateral environmental agreements to which they are party play an important role, globally and domestically, in protecting the environment and that their respective implementation of these agreements is critical to achieving the environmental objectives of these agreements. Accordingly, each Party affirms its commitment to implement the multilateral environmental agreements to which it is a party.

2\. The Parties emphasise the need to enhance the mutual supportiveness between trade and environmental law and policies, through dialogue between the Parties on trade and environmental issues of mutual interest, particularly with respect to the negotiation and implementation of relevant multilateral environmental agreements and trade agreements.

1\. The Parties recognise the importance of cooperation as a mechanism to implement this Chapter, to enhance its benefits and to strengthen the Parties’ joint and individual capacities to protect the environment and to promote sustainable development as they strengthen their trade and investment relations.

2\. Taking account of their national priorities and circumstances, and available resources, the Parties shall cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest among the participating Parties related to the implementation of this Chapter, when there is mutual benefit from that cooperation. This cooperation may be carried out on a bilateral or plurilateral basis between Parties and, subject to consensus by the participating Parties, may include non-governmental bodies or organisations and non-Parties to this Agreement.

3\. Each Party shall designate the authority or authorities responsible for cooperation related to the implementation of this Chapter to serve as its national contact point on matters that relate to coordination of cooperation activities and shall notify the other Parties in writing within 90 days of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party of its contact point. On notifying the other Parties of its contact point, or at any time thereafter through the contact points, a Party may:

(a) share its priorities for cooperation with the other Parties, including the objectives of that cooperation; and

(b) propose cooperation activities related to the implementation of this Chapter to another Party or Parties.

4\. When possible and appropriate, the Parties shall seek to complement and use their existing cooperation mechanisms and take into account relevant work of regional and international organisations.

5\. Cooperation may be undertaken through various means including: dialogues, workshops, seminars, conferences, collaborative programmes and projects; technical assistance to promote and facilitate cooperation and training; the sharing of best practices on policies and procedures; and the exchange of experts.

6\. In developing cooperative activities and programmes, a Party shall, if relevant, identify performance measures and indicators to assist in examining and evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness and progress of specific cooperative activities and programmes and share those measures and indicators, as well as the outcome of any evaluation during or following the completion of a cooperative activity or programme, with the other Parties.

7\. The Parties, through their contact points for cooperation, shall periodically review the implementation and operation of this Article and report their findings, which may include recommendations, to the Committee to inform its review under Article 20.19(3)(c) (Environment Committee and Contact Points). The Parties, through the Committee, may periodically evaluate the necessity of designating an entity to provide administrative and operational support for cooperative activities.

8\. Each Party shall promote public participation in the development and implementation of cooperative activities, as appropriate. This may include activities such as encouraging and facilitating direct contacts and cooperation among relevant entities and the conclusion of arrangements among them for the conduct of cooperative activities under this Chapter.

9\. Where a Party has defined the environmental laws under Article 20.1 to include only laws at the central level of government (first Party), and where another Party (second Party) considers that an environmental law at the sub-central level of government of the first Party is not being effectively enforced by the relevant sub-central government through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties, the second Party may request a dialogue with the first Party. The request shall contain information that is specific and sufficient to enable the first Party to evaluate the matter at issue and an indication of how the matter is negatively affecting trade or investment of the second Party.

10\. All cooperative activities under this Chapter are subject to the availability of funds and of human and other resources, and to the applicable laws and regulations of the participating Parties. The participating Parties shall decide, on a case-by-case basis, the funding of cooperative activities.

#### Article 20.13: Trade and Biodiversity

1\. The Parties recognise the importance of conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and their keyrole in achieving sustainable development.

3\. The Parties recognise the importance of respecting, preserving and maintaining knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles that contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.

4\. The Parties recognise the importance of facilitating access to genetic resources within their respective national jurisdictions, consistent with each Party’s international obligations. The Parties further recognise that some Parties require, through national measures, prior informed consent to access such genetic resources in accordance with national measures and, where such access is granted, the establishment of mutually agreed terms, including with respect to sharing of benefits from the use of such genetic resources, between users and providers.

5\. The Parties also recognise the importance of public participation and consultation, in accordance with their respective law or policy, in the development and implementation of measures concerning the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Each Party shall make publicly available information about its programmes and activities, including cooperative programmes, related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.

6\. Consistent with Article 20.12 (Cooperation Frameworks), the Parties shall cooperate to address matters of mutual interest. Cooperation may include, but is not limited to, exchanging information and experiences in areas related to:

(a) the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity;

(b) the protection and maintenance of ecosystems and ecosystem services; and

(c) access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization.

#### Article 20.14: Invasive Alien Species

1\. The Parties recognise that the movement of terrestrial and aquatic invasive alien species across borders through trade-related pathways can adversely affect the environment, economic activities and development, and human health. The Parties also recognise that the prevention, detection, control and, when possible, eradication, of invasive alien species are critical strategies for managing those adverse impacts.

2\. Accordingly, the Committee shall coordinate with the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures established under Article 7.5 (Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) to identify cooperative opportunities to share information and management experiences on the movement, prevention, detection, control and eradication of invasive alien species, with a view to enhancing efforts to assess and address the risks and adverse impacts of invasive alien species.

#### Article 20.15: Transition to a Low Emissions and Resilient Economy

1\. The Parties acknowledge that transition to a low emissions economy requires collective action.

2\. The Parties recognise that each Party’s actions to transition to a low emissions economy should reflect domestic circumstances and capabilities and, consistent with Article 20.12 (Cooperative Frameworks), Parties shall cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest. Areas of cooperation may include, but are not limited to: energy efficiency; development of cost-effective, low-emissions technologies and alternative, clean and renewable energy sources; sustainable transport and sustainable urban infrastructure development; addressing deforestation and forest degradation; emissions monitoring; market and non-market mechanisms; low-emissions, resilient development and sharing of information and experiences in addressing this issue. Further, the Parties shall, as appropriate, engage in cooperative and capacity-building activities related to transitioning to a low emissions economy.

#### Article 20.16: Marine Capture Fisheries[10]

1\. The Parties acknowledge their role as major consumers, producers and traders of fisheries products and the importance of the marine fisheries sector to their development and to the livelihoods of their fishing communities, including artisanal or small-scale fisheries. The Parties also acknowledge that the fate of marine capture fisheries is an urgent resource problem facing the international community. Accordingly, the Parties recognise the importance of taking measures aimed at the conservation and the sustainable management of fisheries.

2\. In this regard, the Parties acknowledge that inadequate fisheries management, fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity, and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing[[11]](#583d) can have significant negative impacts on trade, development and the environment and recognise the need for individual and collective action to address the problems of overfishing and unsustainable utilisation of fisheries resources.

_3\._ Accordingly, each Party shall seek to operate a fisheries management system that regulates marine wild capture fishing and that is designed to:

(a) prevent overfishing and overcapacity;

(b) reduce bycatch of non-target species and juveniles, including through the regulation of fishing gear that results in bycatch and the regulation of fishing in areas where bycatch is likely to occur; and

(c) promote the recovery of overfished stocks for all marine fisheries in which that Party’s persons conduct fishing activities.

Such a management system shall be based on the best scientific evidence available and on internationally recognised best practices for fisheries management and conservation as reflected in the relevant provisions of international instruments aimed at ensuring the sustainable use and conservation of marine species.[[12]](#f5a2)

4\. Each Party shall promote the long-term conservation of sharks, marine turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, through the implementation and effective enforcement of conservation and management measures. Such measures should include, as appropriate:

(a) for sharks: the collection of species specific data, fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, catch limits, and finning prohibitions;

(b) for marine turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals: fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, conservation and relevant management measures, prohibitions, and other measures in accordance with relevant international agreements to which the Party is party.

5\. The Parties recognise that the implementation of a fisheries management system that is designed to prevent overfishing and overcapacity and to promote the recovery of overfished stocks must include the control, reduction and eventual elimination of all subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. To that end, no Party shall grant or maintain any of the following subsidies[[13]](#43c2) within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement that are specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement:

(a) subsidies for fishing[[14]](#1b97) that negatively affect[[15]](#706f) fish stocks that are in an overfished[[16]](#85ce) condition; and

(b) subsidies provided to any fishing vessel[[17]](#34c6) while listed by the flag State or a relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation or Arrangement for IUU fishing in accordance with the rules and procedures of that organisation or arrangement and in conformity with international law.

6\. Subsidy programmes that are established by a Party before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party and which are inconsistent with paragraph 5(a) shall be brought into conformity with that paragraph as soon as possible and no later than three years[[18]](#9b60) of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

7\. In relation to subsidies that are not prohibited by paragraph 5 (a) or (b), and taking into consideration a Party’s social and developmental priorities, including food security concerns, each Party shall make best efforts to refrain from introducing new, or extending or enhancing existing, subsidies within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement, to the extent they are specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement, that contribute to overfishing or overcapacity.

8\. With a view to achieving the objective of eliminating subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity, the Parties shall review the disciplines in paragraph 5 at regular meetings of the Committee.

9\. Each Party shall notify the other Parties, within one year of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for it and every two years thereafter, of any subsidy within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement that is specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement, that the Party grants or maintains to persons engaged in fishing or fishing related activities.

10\. These notifications shall cover subsidies provided within the previous two-year period and shall include the information required under Article 25.3 of the SCM Agreement and, to the extent possible, the following information:[[19]](#aeda)

(a) programme name;

(b) legal authority for the programme;

(c) catch data by species in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided;

(d) status of the fish stocks in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided (for example, overexploited, depleted, fully exploited, recovering or underexploited);

(e) fleet capacity in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided;

(f) conservation and management measures in place for the relevant fish stock; and

(g) total imports and exports per species.

11\. Each Party shall also provide, to the extent possible, information in relation to other fisheries subsidies that the Party grants or maintains that are not covered by paragraph 5, in particular fuel subsidies.

12\. A Party may request additional information from the notifying Party regarding the notifications under paragraphs 9 and 10\. The notifying Party shall respond to that request as quickly as possible and in a comprehensive manner.

13\. The Parties recognise the importance of concerted international action to address IUU fishing as reflected in regional and international instruments[[20]](#07c0) and shall endeavour to improve cooperation internationally in this regard, including with and through competent international organisations.

14\. In support of efforts to combat IUU fishing practices and to help deter trade in products from species harvested from those practices, each Party shall:

(a) cooperate with other Parties toidentify needs and to build capacity to support the implementation of this Article;

(b) support monitoring, control, surveillance, compliance and enforcement systems, including by adopting, reviewing, or revising, as appropriate measures to:

(i) deter vessels that are flying its flag and its nationals from engaging in IUU fishing activities; and

(ii) address the transhipment at sea of fish or fish products caught through IUU fishing activities;

(c) implement port State measures;

(d) strive to act consistently with relevant conservation and management measures adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations of which it is not a member so as not to undermine those measures; and

(e) endeavour not to undermine catch or trade documentation schemes operated by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations or Arrangements or an intergovernmental organisation whose scope includes the management of shared fisheries resources, including straddling and highly migratory species, where that Party is not a member of those organisations or arrangements.

15\. Consistent with Article 26.2.2 (Publication), a Party shall, to the extent possible, provide other Parties the opportunity to comment on proposed measures that are designed to prevent trade in fisheries products that results from IUU fishing.

#### Article 20.17: Conservation and Trade

1\. The Parties affirm the importance of combating the illegal take[[21]](#1757) of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, and acknowledge that this trade undermines efforts to conserve and sustainably manage those natural resources, has social consequences, distorts legal trade in wild fauna and flora, and reduces the economic and environmental value of these natural resources.

2\. Accordingly, each Party shall adopt, maintain and implement laws, regulations and any other measures to fulfill its obligations under the _Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora_ (CITES).[[22]](#8e58), [[23]](#e636), [[24]](#572e)

3\. The Parties commit to promote conservation and to combat the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora.To that end, the Parties shall:

(a) exchange information and experiences on issues of mutual interest related to combating the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, including combating illegal logging and associated illegal trade, and promoting the legal trade in associated products;

(b) undertake, as appropriate, joint activities on conservation issues of mutual interest, including through relevant regional and international fora; and

(c) endeavour to implement, as appropriate, CITES resolutions that aim to protect and conserve species whose survival is threatened by international trade.

4\. Each Party further commits to:

(a) take appropriate measures to protect and conserve wild fauna and flora that it has identified to be at risk within its territory, including measures to conserve the ecological integrity of specially protected natural areas, for example wetlands;

(b) maintain or strengthen government capacity and institutional frameworks to promote sustainable forest management and wild fauna and flora conservation, and endeavour to enhance public participation and transparency in these institutional frameworks; and

(c) endeavour to develop and strengthen cooperation and consultation with interested non-governmental entities in order to enhance implementation of measures to combat the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora.

5\. In a further effort to address the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, including parts and products thereof, each Party shall take measures to combat, and cooperate to prevent, the trade of wild fauna and flora that, based on credible evidence[[25]](#82f4), were taken or traded in violation of that Party’s law or another applicable law[[26]](#bf4e), the primary purpose of which is to conserve, protect, or manage wild fauna or flora. Such measures shall include sanctions, penalties, or other effective measures, including administrative measures, that can act as a deterrent to such trade. In addition, each Party shall endeavour to take measures to combat the trade of wild fauna and flora transhipped through its territory that, based on credible evidence, were illegally taken or traded.

6\. The Parties recognise that each Party retains the right to exercise administrative, investigatory and enforcement discretion in its implementation of paragraph 5, including by taking into account in relation to each situation the strength of the available evidence and the seriousness of the suspected violation. In addition, the Parties recognise that in implementing paragraph 5, each Party retains the right to make decisions regarding the allocation of administrative, investigatory and enforcement resources.

7\. In order to promote the widest measure of law enforcement cooperation and information sharing between the Parties to combat the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, the Parties shall endeavour to identify opportunities, consistent with their respective law and in accordance with applicable international agreements, to enhance law enforcement cooperation and information sharing, for example by creating and participating in law enforcement networks.

Article 20.18: Environmental Goods and Services

1\. The Parties recognise the importance of trade and investment in environmental goods and services as a means of improving environmental and economic performance and addressing global environmental challenges.

2\. The Parties further recognise the importance of this Agreement to promoting trade and investment in environmental goods and services in the free trade area.

3\. Accordingly, the Committee shall consider issues identified by a Party or Parties related to trade in environmental goods and services, including issues identified as potential non-tariff barriers to that trade. The Parties shall endeavour to address any potential barriers to trade in environmental goods and services that may be identified by a Party, including by working through the Committee and in conjunction with other relevant committees established under this Agreement, as appropriate.

4\. The Parties may develop bilateral and plurilateral cooperative projects on environmental goods and services to address current and future global trade-related environmental challenges.

Article 20.19: Environment Committee and Contact Points

1\. Each Party shall designate and notify a contact point from its relevant authorities within 90 days of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for it, in order to facilitate communication between the Parties in the implementation of this Chapter.
