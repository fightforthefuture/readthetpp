RVC = VOM x 100

Value of the Good

or

d) Net Cost Method (for Automotive Goods Only)

RVC = NC ‑ VNM x 100

NC

where:

**RVC** is the regional value content of a good, expressed as a percentage;

**VNM** is the value of non-originating materials,including materials of undetermined origin, used in the production of the good;

**NC** is the net cost of the good determined in accordance with Article 3.9 (Net Cost);

2\. Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material is used in the production of a good, the following may be counted as originating content for the purpose of determining whether the good meets a regional value content requirement:

(a) the value of processing of the non-originating materials undertaken in the territory of one or more of the Parties; and

(b) the value of any originating material used in the production of the non-originating material undertaken in the territory of one or more of the Parties.

#### Article 3.7: Value of Materials Used in Production

Each Party shall provide that for the purposes of this Chapter, the value of a material is:

(a) for a material imported by the producer of the good, the transaction value of the material at the time of importation, including the costs incurred in the international shipment of the good;

(b) for a material acquired in the territory where the good is produced:

(i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the Party where the producer is located;

(ii) the value as determined for an imported material in subparagraph (a); or

(iii) the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the Party; or

(i) all the costs incurred in the production of the material, which includes general expenses; and

(ii) an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade, or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the self-produced material that is being valued.

#### Article 3.8: Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials

1\. Each Party shall provide that for an originating material, the following expenses may be added to the value of the material, if not included under Article 3.7 (Value of Materials Used in Production):

(a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred to transport the material to the location of the producer of the good;

(b) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material, paid in the territory of one or more of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and

2\. Each Party shall provide that, for a non-originating material or material of undetermined origin, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of the material:

(a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer of the good;

(b) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or more of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and

(c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product.

#### Article 3.27: Verification of Origin

1\. For the purpose of determining whether a good imported into its territory is originating, the importing Party may conduct a verification of any claim for preferential tariff treatment by one or more of the following[[5]](#b45f):

(a) a written request for information from the importer of the good;

(b) a written request for information from the exporter or producer of the good;

(c) a verification visit to the premises of the exporter or producer of the good;

(d) for a textile or apparel good, the procedures set out in Article 4.6 (Verification); or

(e) other procedures as may be decided by the importing Party and the Party where an exporter or producer of the good is located.

2.If an importing Party conducts a verification, it shall accept information directly from the importer, exporter or producer.

3\. If a claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a certification of origin completed by the exporter or producer and, in response to a request for information by an importing Party under paragraph 1(a), the importer does not provide information to the importing Party or the information provided is not sufficient to support a claim for preferential tariff treatment, the importing Party shall request information from the exporter or producer, under paragraph 1(b) or 1(c) before it may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment. The importing Party shall complete the verification, including any additional request to the exporter or producer under paragraph 1(b) or 1(c), within the time provided in paragraph 6(e).[[6]](#0004)

4\. A written request for information or for a verification visit under paragraphs 1(a) through 1(c) shall:

(a) be in English or in an official language of the Party of the person to whom the request is made;

(b) include the identity of the government authority issuing the request;

(c) state the reason for the request, including the specific issue the requesting Party seeks to resolve with the verification;

(d) include sufficient information to identify the good that is being verified;

(e) include a copy of relevant information submitted with the good, including the certification of origin; and

(f) in the case of a verification visit, request the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are going to be visited, and state the proposed date and location for the visit and its specific purpose.

5\. If an importing Party has initiated a verification in accordance with paragraph 1(b) or 1(c), it shall inform the importer of the initiation of the verification.

6\. For a verification under paragraphs 1(a) through 1(c), the importing Party shall:

(a) ensure that a written request for information, or for documentation to be reviewed during a verification visit, is limited to information and documentation to determine whether the good is originating;

(b) describe the information or documentation in sufficient detail to allow the importer, exporter or producer to identify the information and documentation necessary to respond;

(c) allow the importer, exporter or producer at least 30 days from the date of receipt of the written request for information under paragraph 1(a) or 1(b) to respond;

(d) allow the exporter or producer 30 days from the date of receipt of the written request for a visit under paragraph 1(c) to consent or refuse the request; and

(e) make a determination following a verification as expeditiously as possible and no later than 90 days after it receives the information necessary to make the determination, including, if applicable, any information received under paragraph 9, and no later than 365 days after the first request for information or other action under paragraph 1\. If permitted by its law, a Party may extend the 365 day period in exceptional cases, such as where the technical information concerned is very complex.

7\. If an importing Party makes a verification request under paragraph 1(b), it shall, on request of the Party where the exporter or producer is located and in accordance with the importing Party’s laws and regulations, inform that Party. The Parties concerned shall decide the manner and timing of informing the Party where the exporter or producer is located of the verification request. In addition, on request of the importing Party, the Party where the exporter or producer is located may, as it deems appropriate and in accordance with its laws and regulations, assist with the verification. This assistance may include providing a contact point for the verification, collecting information from the exporter or producer on behalf of the importing Party, or other activities in order that the importing Party may make a determination as to whether the good is originating. The importing Party shall not deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment solely on the ground that the Party where the exporter or producer is located did not provide requested assistance.

8\. If an importing Party initiates a verification under paragraph 1(c), it shall, at the time of the request for the visit, inform the Party where the exporter or producer is located and provide the opportunity for the officials of the Party where the exporter or producer is located to accompany them during the visit.

9\. Prior to issuing a written determination, the importing Party shall inform the importer and any exporter or producer that provided information directly to the importing Party, of the results of the verification and, if the importing Party intends to deny preferential tariff treatment, provide those persons a period of at least 30 days for the submission of additional information relating to the origin of the good.

10\. The importing Party shall:

(a) provide the importer with a written determination of whether the good is originating that includes the basis for the determination; and

(b) provide the importer, exporter or producer that provided information during the verification or certified that the good was originating with the results of the verification and the reasons for that result.

11\. During verification, the importing Party shall allow the release of the good, subject to payment of duties or provision of security as provided for in its law. If as a result of the verification the importing Party determines that the good is an originating good, it shall grant preferential tariff treatment to the good and refund any excess duties paid or release any security provided, unless the security also covers other obligations.

12\. If verifications of identical goods by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an importer, exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations relevant to a claim that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods imported, exported or produced by that person until that person demonstrates that the identical goods qualify as originating. For the purposes of this paragraph, “identical goods” means goods that are the same in all respects relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating.

13\. For the purpose of a verification request, it is sufficient for a Party to rely on the contact information of an exporter, producer or importer in a Party provided in a certification of origin.

#### Article 3.28: Determinations on Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment

1\. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 2 or Article 4.7 (Determinations), each Party shall grant a claim for preferential tariff treatment made in accordance with this Chapter for a good that arrives in its territory on or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party. In addition, if permitted by the importing Party, the importing Party shall grant a claim for preferential tariff treatment made in accordance with this Chapter for a good which is imported into its territory or released from customs control on or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

2\. The importing Party may deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment if:

(a) it determines that the good does not qualify for preferential treatment;

(b) pursuant to a verification under Article 3.27 (Verification of Origin), it has not received sufficient information to determine that the good qualifies as originating;

(c) the exporter, producer or importer fails to respond to a written request for information in accordance with Article 3.27 (Verification of Origin);

(d) after receipt of a written notification for a verification visit, the exporter or producer does not provide its written consent in accordance with Article 3.27 (Verification of Origin); or

(e) the importer, exporter or producer fails to comply with the requirements of this Chapter.

3\. If an importing Party denies a claim for preferential tariff treatment, it shall issue a determination to the importer that includes the reasons for the determination.

4\. A Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment for the sole reason that the invoice was issued in a non-Party. If an invoice is issued in a non-Party, a Party shall require that the certification of origin be separate from the invoice.

#### Article 3.29: Refunds and Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment after Importation

1\. Each Party shall provide that an importer may apply for preferential tariff treatment and a refund of any excess duties paid for a good if the importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation, provided that the good would have qualified for preferential tariff treatment when it was imported into the territory of the Party.

2\. As a condition for preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1, the importing Party may require that the importer:

(a) make a claim for preferential tariff treatment;

(b) provide a statement that the good was originating at the time of importation;
