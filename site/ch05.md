(c) identify the requested information with sufficient specificity for the other Party to locate and provide the information.

5\. The Party from which the information is requested under paragraph 3 shall, subject to its law and any relevant international agreements to which it is a party, provide a written response containing the requested information.

6\. For the purposes of paragraph 3, “a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity” means a suspicion based on relevant factual information obtained from public or private sources comprising one or more of the following:

(a) historical evidence of non-compliance with laws or regulations that govern importations by an importer or exporter;

#### Article 5.3: Advance Rulings

1\. Each Party shall issue, prior to the importation of a good of a Party into its territory, a written advance ruling at the written request of an importer in its territory, or an exporter or producer in the territory of another Party,[[1]](#c277) with regard to:[[2]](#c28e)

(a) tariff classification;

(b) the application of customs valuation criteria for a particular case in accordance with the Customs Valuation Agreement;

(c) whether a good is originating in accordance with Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures); and

(d) such other matters as the Parties may decide.

2\. Each Party shall issue an advance ruling as expeditiously as possible and in no case later than 150 daysafter it receives a request, provided that the requester has submitted all the information that the receiving Party requires to make the advance ruling. This includes a sample of the good for which the requester is seeking an advance ruling if requested by the receiving Party. In issuing an advance ruling, the Party shall take into account the facts and circumstances that the requester has provided. For greater certainty, a Party may decline to issue an advance ruling if the facts and circumstances forming the basis of the advance ruling are the subject of administrative or judicial review. A Party that declines to issue an advance ruling shall promptly notify the requester in writing, setting out the relevant facts and circumstances and the basis for its decision to decline to issue the advance ruling.

3\. Each Party shall provide that its advance rulings shall take effect on the date that they are issued or on another date specified in the ruling, and remain in effect for at least three years, provided that the law, facts and circumstances on which the ruling is based remain unchanged. If a Party’s law provides that an advance ruling becomes ineffective after a fixed period of time, that Party shall endeavour to provide procedures that allow the requester to renew the ruling expeditiously before it becomes ineffective, in situations in which the law, facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based remain unchanged.

4\. After issuing an advance ruling, the Party may modify or revoke the advance ruling if there is a change in the law, facts or circumstances on which the ruling was based, if the ruling was based on inaccurate or false information, or if the ruling was in error.

5\. A Party may apply a modification or revocation in accordance with paragraph 4 after it provides notice of the modification or revocation and the reasons for it.

6\. No Party shall apply a revocation or modification retroactively to the detriment of the requester unless the ruling was based on inaccurate or false information provided by the requester.

7\. Each Party shall ensure that requesters have access to administrative review of advance rulings.

8\. Subject to any confidentiality requirements in its law, each Party shall endeavour to make its advance rulings publicly available including online.

#### Article 5.4: Response to Requests for Advice or Information

(c) the eligibility requirements for goods under Article 2.6 (Goods Re-entered after Repair and Alteration);

(d) country of origin marking,if it is a prerequisite for importation; and

(e) other matters as the Parties may decide.
