### Subsection A: General Patents

#### Article 18.37: Patentable Subject Matter

1\. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4, each Party shall make patents available for any invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of technology, provided that the invention is new, involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial application.[[30]](#2b79)

2\. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4 and consistent with paragraph 1, each Party confirms that patents are available for inventions claimed as at least one of the following: new uses of a known product, new methods of using a known product, or new processes of using a known product. A Party may limit those new processes to those that do not claim the use of the product as such.

3\. A Party may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect _ordre public_ or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to nature or the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by its law. A Party may also exclude from patentability:

(a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals;

(b) animals other than microorganisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals, other than non-biological and microbiological processes.

(b) occurred within 12 months prior to the date of the filing of the application in the territory of the Party.

#### Article 18.39: Patent Revocation

1\. Each Party shall provide that a patent may be cancelled, revoked or nullified only on grounds that would have justified a refusal to grant the patent. A Party may also provide that fraud, misrepresentation or inequitable conduct may be the basis for cancelling, revoking or nullifying a patent or holding a patent unenforceable.

2\. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may provide that a patent may be revoked, provided it is done in a manner consistent with Article 5A of the Paris Convention and the TRIPS Agreement.

#### Article 18.40: Exceptions

A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.

4\. In determining the amount of damages under paragraph 3, each Party’s judicial authorities shall have the authority to consider, among other things, any legitimate measure of value the right holder submits, which may include lost profits, the value of the infringed goods or services measured by the market price, or the suggested retail price.

11\. If a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint a technical or other expert in a civil proceeding concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right and require that the parties to the proceeding pay the costs of that expert, that Party should seek to ensure that those costs are reasonable and related appropriately, among other things, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings.

12\. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings:

(a) at least with respect to pirated copyright goods and counterfeit trademark goods, its judicial authorities have the authority, at the right holder’s request, to order that the infringing goods be destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances, without compensation of any sort;

(b) its judicial authorities have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of the infringing goods be, without undue delay and without compensation of any sort, destroyed or disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimise the risk of further infringement; and

(c) in regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed is not sufficient, other than in exceptional circumstances, to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce.

13\. Without prejudice to its law governing privilege, the protection of confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right, its judicial authorities have the authority, on a justified request of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative, the alleged infringer to provide to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least for the purpose of collecting evidence, relevant information as provided for in its applicable laws and regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or controls. The information may include information regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement and the means of production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing goods or services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be involved in the production and distribution of the goods or services and of their channels of distribution.

15\. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities have the authority to order a party at whose request measures were taken and that has abused enforcement procedures with regard to intellectual property rights, including trademarks, geographical indications, patents, copyright and related rights and industrial designs, to provide to a party wrongfully enjoined or restrained adequate compensation for the injury suffered because of that abuse. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the applicant to pay the defendant expenses, which may include appropriate attorney’s fees.

Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to those procedures.

3\. In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or other taking into custody of suspected infringing goods, materials and implements relevant to the infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the infringement.

Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities[[116]](#8078) to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the law of the Party providing the procedures, there is _prima facie_ an infringement of the right holder’s intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspect goods reasonably recognisable by its competent authorities. The requirement to provide that information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.

3\. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance does not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. A Party may provide that the security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the defendant harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good.

4\. Without prejudice to a Party’s law pertaining to privacy or the confidentiality of information:

(a) if a Party’s competent authorities have detained or suspended the release of goods that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods, that Party may provide that its competent authorities have the authority to inform the right holder without undue delay of the names and addresses of the consignor, exporter, consignee or importer; a description of the goods; the quantity of the goods; and, if known, the country of origin of the goods;[[117]](#f383) or

(b) if a Party does not provide its competent authority with the authority referred to in subparagraph (a) when suspect goods are detained or suspended from release, it shall provide, at least in cases of imported goods, its competent authorities with the authority to provide the information specified in subparagraph (a) to the right holder normally within 30 working days of the seizure or determination that the goods are counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods.

5\. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures _ex officio_[[118]](#e624) with respect to goods under customs control[[119]](#b8a9) that are:

(a) imported;

(b) destined for export;[[120]](#e71d) or

(c) in transit,[[121]](#70d3),[[122]](#0e5b)

and that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods.

6\. Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent authorities may determine within a reasonable period of time after the initiation of the procedures described in paragraph 1, paragraph 5(a), paragraph 5(b) and, if applicable, paragraph 5(c), whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual property right.[[123]](#a3e0) If a Party provides administrative procedures for the determination of an infringement, it may also provide its authorities with the authority to impose administrative penalties or sanctions, which may include fines or the seizure of the infringing goods following a determination that the goods are infringing.

7\. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to order the destruction of goods following a determination that the goods are infringing. In cases in which the goods are not destroyed, each Party shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, the goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm to the right holder. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce.

8\. If a Party establishes or assesses, in connection with the procedures described in this Article, an application fee, storage fee or destruction fee, that fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these procedures.

9\. This Article also shall apply to goods of a commercial nature sent in small consignments. A Party may exclude from the application of this Article small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers’ personal luggage.[[124]](#831f)

#### Article 18.77: Criminal Procedures and Penalties

4\. Recognising the need to address the unauthorised copying[[130]](#8728) of a cinematographic work from a performance in a movie theatre that causes significant harm to a right holder in the market for that work, and recognising the need to deter such harm, each Party shall adopt or maintain measures, which shall at a minimum include, but need not be limited to, appropriate criminal procedures and penalties.

5\. With respect to the offences for which this Article requires a Party to provide for criminal procedures and penalties, each Party shall ensure that criminal liability for aiding and abetting is available under its law.

6\. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, each Party shall provide the following:

(c) Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the alleged offence, documentary evidence relevant to the alleged offence and assets derived from, or obtained through the alleged infringing activity. If a Party requires identification of items subject to seizure as a prerequisite for issuing a judicial order referred to in this subparagraph, that Party shall not require the items to be described in greater detail than necessary to identify them for the purpose of seizure.

[(d) Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture, at least for serious offences, of any assets derived from or obtained through the infringing activity.](https://medium.com/p/3479efdc7adf/edit)

In cases in which counterfeit trademark goods and pirated copyright goods are not destroyed, the judicial or other competent authorities shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, those goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid causing any harm to the right holder. Each Party shall further provide that forfeiture or destruction under this subparagraph and subparagraph (c) shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant.

(f) Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to release or, in the alternative, provide access to, goods, material, implements, and other evidence held by the relevant authority to a right holder for civil[[133]](#6324) infringement proceedings.

7\. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, a Party may provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or forfeiture of assets, or alternatively, a fine, the value of which corresponds to the assets derived from, or obtained directly or indirectly through, the infringing activity.

#### Article 18.78: Trade Secrets[135]

1\. In the course of ensuring effective protection against unfair competition as provided in Article 10_bis_ of the Paris Convention, each Party shall ensure that persons have the legal means to prevent trade secrets lawfully in their control from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others (including state-owned enterprises) without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices.[[136]](#0ffb) As used in this Chapter, trade secrets encompass, at a minimum, undisclosed information as provided for in Article 39.2 of the TRIPS Agreement.

2\. Subject to paragraph 3, each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties for one or more of the following:

2\. Each Party shall adopt or maintain appropriate laws, regulations, policies, orders, government-issued guidelines, or administrative or executive decrees that provide that its central government agencies use only non-infringing computer software protected by copyright and related rights, and, if applicable, only use that computer software in a manner authorised by the relevant licence. These measures shall apply to the acquisition and management of the software for government use.[[146]](#e9af)

## Section J: Internet Service Providers[147]

#### Article 18.81: Definitions

For the purposes of this Section:

the term **copyright** includes related rights; and

**Internet Service Provider** means:

(a) a provider of online services for the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing, undertaking the function in Article 18.82.2(a) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours); or

(b) a provider of online services undertaking the functions in Article 18.82.2(c) or Article 18.82.2(d) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours).

For greater certainty, Internet Service Provider includes a provider of the services listed above that engages in caching carried out through an automated process.

#### Article 18.82: Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours[148]

1\. The Parties recognise the importance of facilitating the continued development of legitimate online services operating as intermediaries and, in a manner consistent with Article 41 of the TRIPS Agreement, providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action by right holders against copyright infringement covered under this Chapter that occurs in the online environment. Accordingly, each Party shall ensure that legal remedies are available for right holders to address such copyright infringement and shall establish or maintain appropriate safe harbours in respect of online services that are Internet Service Providers. This framework of legal remedies and safe harbours shall include:

(a) legal incentives[[149]](#206f) for Internet Service Providers to cooperate with copyright owners to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials or, in the alternative, to take other action to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and

(b) limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary relief against Internet Service Providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.[[150]](#0344)

2\. The limitations described in paragraph 1(b) shall include limitations in respect of the following functions:

(a) transmitting, routing or providing connections for material without modification of its content[[151]](#0b47) or the intermediate and transient storage of that material done automatically in the course of such a technical process;

(b) caching carried out through an automated process;

(c) storage,[[152]](#a159) at the direction of a user, of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the Internet Service Provider;[[153]](#1e82) and

(d) referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories.

3\. To facilitate effective action to address infringement, each Party shall prescribe in its law conditions for Internet Service Providers to qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b), or, alternatively, shall provide for circumstances under which Internet Service Providers do not qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b):[[154]](#fd67),[[155]](#9fca)

(a) With respect to the functions referred to in paragraph 2(c) and paragraph 2(d), these conditions shall include a requirement for Internet Service Providers to expeditiously remove or disable access to material residing on their networks or systems upon obtaining actual knowledge of the copyright infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent, such as through receiving a notice[[156]](#301d) of alleged infringement from the right holder or a person authorised to act on its behalf,

(b) An Internet Service Provider that removes or disables access to material in good faith under subparagraph (a) shall be exempt from any liability for having done so, provided that it takes reasonable steps in advance or promptly after to notify the person whose material is removed or disabled.[[157]](#c88a)

4\. If a system for counter-notices is provided under a Party’s law, and if material has been removed or access has been disabled in accordance with paragraph 3, that Party shall require that the Internet Service Provider restores the material subject to a counter-notice, unless the person giving the original notice seeks judicial relief within a reasonable period of time.

5\. Each Party shall ensure that monetary remedies are available in its legal system against any person that makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notice or counter-notice that causes injury to any interested party[[158]](#0437) as a result of an Internet Service Provider relying on the misrepresentation.

6\. Eligibility for the limitations in paragraph 1 shall not be conditioned on the Internet Service Provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity.

7\. Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in accordance with that Party’s legal system, and consistent with principles of due process and privacy, that enable a copyright owner that has made a legally sufficient claim of copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet Service Provider information in the provider’s possession identifying the alleged infringer, in cases in which that information is sought for the purpose of protecting or enforcing that copyright.

8\. The Parties understand that the failure of an Internet Service Provider to qualify for the limitations in paragraph 1(b) does not itself result in liability. Further, this Article is without prejudice to the availability of other limitations and exceptions to copyright, or any other defences under a Party’s legal system.

9\. The Parties recognise the importance, in implementing their obligations under this Article, of taking into account the impacts on right holders and Internet Service Providers.

(A) The Parties will consider a justified request from Viet Nam for an extension of the transition period for up to two additional years. Viet Nam’s request shall include the reason for the requested extension. Viet Nam may avail itself of this one-time extension upon providing a request in accordance with this paragraph unless the Commission decides otherwise within 60 days of receiving the request. No later than the date on which the additional two-year period expires, Viet Nam shall provide to the Commission in writing a report on the measures it has taken to fulfill its obligation under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics).

Viet Nam’s request shall include the reason for the request. The Commission shall decide pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article 27.3 (Decision-Making), whether to grant the request based on relevant factors, which may include capacity as well as other appropriate circumstances. Viet Nam shall make the request no later than one year prior to the expiration of the two-year transition period referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (A). The Parties shall give due consideration to that request. If the Committee grants Viet Nam’s request, Viet Nam shall provide to the Commission in writing a report on the measures it has taken to fulfill its obligations under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics) no later than the date on which the extension period expires.

(C) Viet Nam’s implementation of Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics) during three years after the conclusion of the extension period referred to in paragraph (A) shall not be subject to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement).

++ If there are unreasonable delays in Viet Nam in the initiation of the filing of marketing approval applications for new pharmaceutical products after Viet Nam implements its obligations under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics) in connection with subparagraphs (f)(xxiii) and (f)(xxiv), Viet Nam may consider adopting measures to incentivize the timely initiation of the filing of these applications with a view to the introduction of new pharmaceutical products in its market. To that end, Viet Nam shall notify the other Parties through the Commission and consult with them on such a proposed measure. Such consultations shall begin within 30 days of a request from an interested Party, and shall provide adequate time and opportunity to resolve any concerns. In addition, any such measure shall respect legitimate commercial considerations and take into account the need for incentives for the development of new pharmaceutical products and for the expeditious marketing approval in Viet Nam of such products.

2\. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall preclude the adoption by New Zealand of measures it deems necessary to protect indigenous plant species in fulfilment of its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi, provided that such measures are not used as a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination against a person of another Party.

3\. The consistency of any measures referred to in paragraph 2 with the obligations in paragraph 1 shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement.

4\. The interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi, including as to the nature of the rights and obligations arising under it, shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement.

A panel established under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel) may be requested to determine only whether any measure referred to in paragraph 2 is inconsistent with a Party’s rights under this Agreement.

**Annex 18-B**

**Chile**

1\. Nothing in Article 18.50.1 or Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) or Article 18.52 (Biologics) prevents Chile from maintaining or applying the provisions of Article 91 of Chile’s Law No. 19.039 on Industrial Property, as in effect on the date of agreement in principle of this Agreement.

2\. Notwithstanding Article 1.2 (Relation to Other Agreements), paragraph 1 is without prejudice to any Party’s rights and obligations under an international agreement in effect prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Chile, including any rights and obligations under a trade agreement between Chile and another Party.

**Annex 18-D**

**Peru**

**Part 1: Applicable to Article 18.46 and Article 18.48**

To the extent that Andean Decision 486, _Common Industrial Property Regime_, and Andean Decision 689, _Adequacy of Certain Articles of Decision 486_, restricts Peru’s implementation of its obligations set forth in Article 18.46.3 (Patent Term Adjustments for Patent Office Delays) and Article 18.48.2 (Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Curtailment), Peru commits to make its best efforts to obtain a waiver from the Andean Community that allows it to adjust its patent term in a way that is consistent with Article 18.46.3 and Article 18.48.2\. Further, if Peru demonstrates that the Andean Community withheld its request for a waiver despite its best efforts, Peru will continue ensuring that it does not discriminate with respect to the availability or enjoyment of patent rights based on the field of technology, the place of invention, and whether products are imported or locally produced. Thus, Peru confirms that the treatment of pharmaceutical patents will be no less favourable than treatment of other patents in respect of the processing and examination of patent applications.

**Part 2: Applicable to Article 18.50 and Article 18.52**

1\. If Peru relies, pursuant to Article 18.50.1(b) (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), on a marketing approval granted by another Party, and grants approval within six months of the date of the filing of a complete application for marketing approval filed in Peru, Peru may provide that the protection specified in Article 18.50.1(b) and Article 18.52 (Biologics), as applicable, shall begin with the date of the first marketing approval relied on. In implementing Article 18.50.1(b) and Article 18.52.1(b)(i), Peru may apply the period of protection established in Article 16.10.2(b) of the _United States — Peru Trade Promotion Agreement_, done at Washington, District of Columbia, April 12, 2006.

2\. Peru may apply paragraph 1 to Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data).

(d) induce Internet Service Providers offering information location tools to remove within a specified period of time any reproductions of material that they make, and communicate to the public, as part of offering the information location tool upon receiving a notice of alleged infringement and after the original material has been removed from the electronic location set out in the notice; and

(e) induce Internet service providers carrying out the function referred to in Article 18.82.2(c) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours) to remove or disable access to material upon becoming aware of a decision of a court of that Party to the effect that the person storing the material infringes copyright in the material.

2\. For a Party to which Article 18.82.3 and Article 18.82.4 (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours) do not apply pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Annex, and in light of, among other things, paragraph 1(b) of this Annex, for the purposes of Article 18.82.1(a), legal incentives shall not mean the conditions for Internet Service Providers to qualify for the limitations provided for in Article 18.82.1(b), as set out in Article 18.82.3.
